                    <h1>History</h1>
                        <p>Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary based on French terminology. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres. Becoming a ballet dancer requires years of training. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures to evolve the art. (from Wikipedia)</p>

                    <h1>Classical Ballet</h1>
                        <p>Classical ballet is based on traditional ballet technique and vocabulary. There are different styles of classical ballet that are related to their areas of origin, such as French ballet, Italian ballet and Russian ballet. Several of the classical ballet styles are associated with specific training methods, which are typically named after their creators. For example, the Cecchetti method is named after its creator, Italian dancer Enrico Cecchetti and the Vaganova method is named after Russian ballerina Agrippina Vaganova.  Some examples of classical ballet productions are: Swan Lake, The Nutcracker, and Sleeping Beauty. (from Wikipedia) </p>

                    <h1>NeoClassical</h1>
                    <p>Neoclassical ballet is a style that utilizes classical ballet technique and vocabulary, but deviates from classical ballet in its use of the abstract. In Neo-Classical Ballet, there often is no clear plot, costumes or scenery. Music choice can be diverse and will often include music that is also neo-classical (e.g. Stravinsky, Webern). Neo- Classical ballet opens up the use of space to multiple possibilities, as the elimination of the necessity of formalities and story telling allows far more possibilities for architecture and design in choreography. George Balanchine is widely considered the creator of the Neo-Classical Ballet style. (from Wikipedia)</p>

                    <h1>I Love Ballet</h1>
                        <p>I love ballet because...well, there are many reasons! I guess the main reason I love ballet is because it presents me with such a big chalenge, much like coding! For me, ballet is a workout for the mind, body and spirit. Every class for me is a struggle to remember all that I've learned, to try to improve and most of all, to remind myself to relax and have fun and enjoy myself! I have studied ballet a little as a child and most of my adult years. For me ballet is a passion, and although it brings its share of frustrations and disappointments, I feel very lucky to live in a city where I can be a part of this exraordinary art form as both a student and a patron. My goal is to keep dancing and improving as long as I live.</p>
